# Suppliers Analysis (a workshop by Lokad)
This project aims to analyze the suppliers’ situation of CM, a fictitious European company selling outdoor clothing and sporting equipment1. The project uses Python and pandas to perform data manipulation and visualization on various data sources, such as items, purchase orders, and suppliers.

# Data Sources
The project uses three data sources in tab-separated values (TSV) format:

- *Items.tsv*: contains information about the items sold by CM, such as reference, supplier, buy price, sell price, category, and brand.
- *Purchase Orders.tsv* : contains information about the purchase orders made by CM, such as reference, delivery date, order quantity, delivery quantity, net amount, and status.
- *Suppliers.tsv* : contains information about the suppliers of CM, such as name and lead time.

# Data Analysis
The project performs data analysis on the following aspects:

The global trend of CM business: how the purchase quantities and net amounts have changed over time.
The dependency and profitability of certain suppliers: how much CM relies on each supplier and what margin they can expect from them.
The reliability and quality of suppliers: how well the suppliers meet the delivery deadlines and provide high-quality products that meet CM’s standards2.
The project uses pandas to manipulate and aggregate the data, and matplotlib and plotly to create line charts and treemaps to visualize the results.

# Conclusion
The project draws some conclusions from the data analysis and identifies some potential risks and vulnerabilities in CM’s suppliers’ management3. The project also discusses some limitations of the analysis and suggests some possible improvements for future work.
